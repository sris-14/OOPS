# OOPS
# Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS): Simple and Detailed Notes

---
* in Python
## 1. What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a way to write computer programs by creating "objects." Think of objects as real-world things, like a car, a dog, or a toy. Each object has two parts:
- **Attributes** (what it has, like color or size).
- **Behaviors** (what it can do, like move or bark).

### Why Do We Use OOPS?
1. **Reusability:** We can use the same code in many places.
2. **Easy to Manage:** Makes it easier to add new features or fix problems.
3. **Safety:** Keeps important parts hidden from others.

---

## 2. Encapsulation (Keeping Things Safe)

Encapsulation means hiding some details and only showing what is needed. It’s like a TV remote – you can press buttons without knowing how it works inside.

### Key Points:
- **Public:** Anyone can see it.
- **Private:** Only the creator can see it.
- **Protected:** Special friends (subclasses) can see it.

### Example:
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name  # Private
        self.__age = age    # Private

    def get_details(self):
        return f"Name: {self.__name}, Age: {self.__age}"

    def set_age(self, age):
        if age > 0:
            self.__age = age
        else:
            print("Invalid age")

# Usage
student = Student("Srishti", 21)
print(student.get_details())
student.set_age(22)
print(student.get_details())
```

### Common Mistake:
Trying to access private things directly:
```python
print(student.__name)  # Error
```
**Solution:** Use special methods like `get_details`.

---

## 3. Inheritance (Like Family Traits)

Inheritance is when one class gets the features of another class. Imagine you inherit your parents' eye color or height.

### Types of Inheritance:
1. **Single Inheritance:** One child, one parent.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A child has a parent and a grandparent.
3. **Multiple Inheritance:** A child has two parents.

### Example:
#### Single Inheritance:
```python
class Parent:
    def show_parent(self):
        print("I am the parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    def show_child(self):
        print("I am the child class")

# Usage
obj = Child()
obj.show_parent()
obj.show_child()
```

#### Multilevel Inheritance:
```python
class Grandparent:
    def show_grandparent(self):
        print("I am the grandparent class")

class Parent(Grandparent):
    def show_parent(self):
        print("I am the parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    def show_child(self):
        print("I am the child class")

# Usage
obj = Child()
obj.show_grandparent()
obj.show_parent()
obj.show_child()
```

#### Multiple Inheritance:
```python
class Parent1:
    def show_parent1(self):
        print("I am parent 1")

class Parent2:
    def show_parent2(self):
        print("I am parent 2")

class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
    def show_child(self):
        print("I am the child")

# Usage
obj = Child()
obj.show_parent1()
obj.show_parent2()
obj.show_child()
```

### Mistake:
Using inheritance for things that don’t match, like saying "A dog is a car." Use it only if it "is a" relationship.

---

## 4. Polymorphism (One Thing, Many Forms)

Polymorphism means one thing can do different jobs. For example, a remote can work with a TV, an AC, or a music system.

### Types of Polymorphism:
1. **Method Overloading:** Same name, different inputs.
2. **Method Overriding:** A child changes how the parent works.

### Example:
#### Method Overloading:
```python
def add(a, b, c=0):
    return a + b + c

print(add(2, 3))        # 5
print(add(2, 3, 4))     # 9
```

#### Method Overriding:
```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("I am the parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("I am the child")

# Usage
obj = Child()
obj.show()  # I am the child
```

### Mistake:
Not using `super()` to call the parent.

**Solution:**
```python
class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        super().show()
        print("I am the child")
```

---

## 5. Abstraction (Hiding the Details)

Abstraction is like using a phone – you can make a call without knowing how it works inside.

### Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.length = length
        self.breadth = breadth

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

# Usage
rectangle = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(rectangle.area())
```

### Mistake:
Trying to use an abstract class directly:
```python
shape = Shape()  # Error
```
**Solution:** Use child classes instead.

---

## 6. SOLID Design Principles (Write Better Code)

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each class does one job.
2. **Open/Closed:** Code can grow without breaking old parts.
3. **Liskov Substitution:** A child class can replace a parent class.
4. **Interface Segregation:** Classes should not have to use things they don’t need.
5. **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstract ideas, not details.

### Example for Open/Closed:
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.length = length
        self.breadth = breadth

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

def calculate_area(shape):
    print(f"Area: {shape.area()}")

# Usage
rectangle = Rectangle(10, 20)
circle = Circle(10)
calculate_area(rectangle)
calculate_area(circle)
```

---

## 7. Common Mistakes in OOPS

1. **Overusing Inheritance:** Leads to confusion.
   - **Fix:** Use only when it makes sense (e.g., "is a" relationship).

2. **Not Using Encapsulation:** Exposing private data directly.
   - **Fix:** Use getter and setter methods.

3. **Ignoring Polymorphism:** Repeating code instead of reusing it.
   - **Fix:** Use polymorphism to make code cleaner.

4. **Not Following Design Principles:** Leads to messy and hard-to-fix code.
   - **Fix:** Follow SOLID principles.

## 8. OOPS vs Procedural Programming

| Feature              | OOPS                         | Procedural Programming         |
|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Object-based                | Function-based                 |
| **Data Security**    | High (Encapsulation)        | Low                            |
| **Code Reusability** | High (Inheritance, Polymorphism) | Moderate                      |
| **Scalability**      | Better                      | Limited                        |
| **Real-World Model** | Closer                      | Less Close                     |

---

## Final Notes

- Think of OOPS as building blocks. Each block (class) has its role.
- Practice with simple examples like animals, vehicles, or gadgets.
- Write clean, reusable, and easy-to-understand code!

# Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS): Placement-Ready Notes

---

## 1. What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming model that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities and combine data (attributes) and methods (behaviors).

### Key Features:
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data safe by hiding it inside objects.
- **Inheritance**: Passing down traits from one object to another.
- **Polymorphism**: Having one thing that works in different ways.
- **Abstraction**: Showing only the important parts, hiding details.

---

## 2. Why Use OOPS?

1. **Reusability:** Reuse code with minimal changes.
2. **Modularity:** Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Security:** Protect data using encapsulation.
4. **Scalability:** Build software that can grow with ease.

---

## 3. Encapsulation (Keeping Things Safe)

Encapsulation hides sensitive data and only exposes required functionality. It protects internal states and enforces rules for accessing and modifying data.

### Example:
```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.__owner = owner  # Private variable
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            return self.__balance

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return self.__balance

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Usage
account = Account("Srishti", 1000)
print(account.get_balance())  # Access through getter method
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())
```

---

## 4. Inheritance (Family Traits)

Inheritance allows a class (child) to reuse properties and methods of another class (parent). This reduces redundancy.

### Types of Inheritance:
- **Single Inheritance:** One child inherits from one parent.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A child inherits from a parent, who also has a parent.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** A child inherits from multiple parents.

### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

# Usage
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.sound())
```

---

## 5. Polymorphism (Many Forms)

Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different types.

### Types of Polymorphism:
1. **Method Overloading:** Same method name, different parameters (not directly supported in Python, simulated with default arguments).
2. **Method Overriding:** A child class redefines a method from its parent.

### Example:
#### Method Overriding:
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.length = length
        self.breadth = breadth

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

# Usage
shape = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(shape.area())
```

---

## 6. Abstraction (Hiding Details)

Abstraction focuses on essential details while hiding the internal implementation. Abstract classes and methods are used for this purpose.

### Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return "Car engine started."

# Usage
vehicle = Car()
print(vehicle.start_engine())
```

---

## 7. SOLID Principles (For Better Code)

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one job.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subclasses should be replaceable by their parent classes without breaking the code.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they don’t use.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

#### Example for OCP:
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.length = length
        self.breadth = breadth

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

# Usage
shapes = [Rectangle(10, 20), Circle(10)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.area())
```
* in python
**Refactoring to SRP:**

```python
class Invoice:
    def calculate_total(self):
        # Logic to calculate total amount
        pass

class EmailService:
    def send_invoice(self):
        # Logic to send the invoice via email
        pass
```

Here, `Invoice` is now only responsible for calculating totals, while `EmailService` handles sending invoices.

---

#### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Definition:**
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Explanation:**
A class or function should allow behavior to be added without modifying its existing code. This principle promotes the use of inheritance or interfaces, enabling the extension of functionality without altering the core structure.

**Example:**

Consider a `Shape` class with a `calculate_area` method:

```python
class Shape:
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius
```

If we want to add a `Triangle` class in the future, we can do so without modifying the `Rectangle` or `Circle` classes.

---

#### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Definition:**
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Explanation:**
A subclass should extend the functionality of the parent class without changing the expected behavior. The derived class should be substitutable for the base class without causing errors or unexpected behavior.

**Example:**

```python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Sparrow(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Sparrow flies")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise Exception("Penguins cannot fly")
```

Here, substituting `Penguin` for `Bird` breaks the expected behavior. To follow LSP, you could rethink the design, such as creating an interface `FlyingBird` for birds that can fly.

---

#### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Definition:**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Explanation:**
Instead of having one large interface with many methods, break it into smaller, more specific interfaces. This ensures that classes only implement the methods that are relevant to them.

**Example:**

```python
class Printer:
    def print(self, text):
        pass

class Scanner:
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner):
    def print(self, text):
        pass
    def scan(self, document):
        pass
```

**Refactoring to ISP:**

```python
class Printer:
    def print(self, text):
        pass

class Scanner:
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner):
    def print(self, text):
        pass
    def scan(self, document):
        pass
```

Instead of forcing a `MultiFunctionPrinter` to implement both `Printer` and `Scanner`, break them into smaller, more focused interfaces.

---

#### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Definition:**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Explanation:**
This principle suggests that high-level classes should rely on interfaces or abstractions rather than low-level details, which promotes loose coupling.

**Example:**

```python
class LightBulb:
    def turn_on(self):
        print("LightBulb: turned on")
    
    def turn_off(self):
        print("LightBulb: turned off")

class Switch:
    def __init__(self, bulb):
        self.bulb = bulb

    def operate(self):
        pass
```

**Refactoring to DIP:**

```python
class Switchable:
    def turn_on(self):
        pass
    
    def turn_off(self):
        pass

class LightBulb(Switchable):
    def turn_on(self):
        print("LightBulb: turned on")
    
    def turn_off(self):
        print("LightBulb: turned off")

class Switch:
    def __init__(self, device: Switchable):
        self.device = device

    def operate(self):
        self.device.turn_on()
```

Here, `Switch` no longer depends directly on `LightBulb`, but on the abstraction `Switchable`, allowing the use of any object that implements `Switchable`. This makes it easier to add new devices (like a fan) without modifying `Switch`.

---

By applying the **SOLID** principles, you improve code maintainability, extensibility, and readability. Each principle works together to help ensure that the system remains modular and flexible.

---

Yes, the **SOLID** principles are specifically designed for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. They provide guidelines that help in creating a more maintainable and flexible codebase by focusing on the design and structure of classes and objects. Here's a brief overview of how each principle fits within OOP:

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** in OOP:
   - **Why it matters in OOP**: In OOP, classes represent entities with behaviors and attributes. SRP ensures that each class focuses on a single responsibility, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
   - **Impact**: A class should only have one reason to change. If a class handles multiple responsibilities, it's harder to modify and test. By keeping it focused on one responsibility, you improve maintainability and reusability.
   - **OOP Example**: Instead of having a class that handles both user authentication and data storage, you would have separate classes: one for authentication and another for storage.

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** in OOP:
   - **Why it matters in OOP**: OCP encourages designing classes that can be easily extended without altering their existing behavior. This is particularly useful when adding new features or making changes in the system.
   - **Impact**: It allows you to modify the behavior of an object without modifying its original source code, which is critical for OOP when dealing with inheritance and polymorphism.
   - **OOP Example**: A base `Shape` class with subclasses like `Rectangle`, `Circle`, etc., where new shapes can be added without modifying the base `Shape` class.

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** in OOP:
   - **Why it matters in OOP**: LSP ensures that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their parent class without affecting the program's correctness. This is important in inheritance-based design.
   - **Impact**: When a subclass is used in place of its superclass, the subclass should behave as the superclass would, preserving the integrity of the system.
   - **OOP Example**: If a method works with a `Bird` class, it should work just as well if you replace the `Bird` with a subclass like `Sparrow` or `Eagle`, as long as they follow the same interface.

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** in OOP:
   - **Why it matters in OOP**: ISP promotes the idea that clients should only depend on interfaces they use. It avoids large interfaces with many methods that force implementing classes to provide unnecessary functionality.
   - **Impact**: It results in smaller, more specific interfaces, leading to better flexibility and reducing the coupling between client classes and their interfaces.
   - **OOP Example**: Instead of having a `MultifunctionPrinter` class that implements all methods (printing, scanning, faxing), you can break it down into smaller interfaces (`Printer`, `Scanner`, `Fax`) so that classes only implement what they need.

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** in OOP:
   - **Why it matters in OOP**: DIP shifts the design focus from high-level modules depending on low-level modules to both depending on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). This reduces the direct dependency between classes and promotes loose coupling.
   - **Impact**: It allows for easier modification of behavior and system expansion. High-level components don't need to be modified when low-level components change, as long as they follow the abstract contracts.
   - **OOP Example**: In the `Switch` example, instead of the `Switch` depending directly on a `LightBulb`, it depends on the abstraction `Switchable`. This means the `Switch` can work with any class that implements `Switchable` (like `Fan`, `Lamp`, etc.).

---

### Conclusion:

In OOP, these principles encourage a more structured and flexible approach to software design. By following SOLID, developers can create systems that are easier to extend, test, and maintain, especially as projects grow in size and complexity.

# Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS): Simple and Detailed Notes

---

## 1. What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a way to write computer programs by creating "objects." Think of objects as real-world things, like a car, a dog, or a toy. Each object has two parts:
- **Attributes** (what it has, like color or size).
- **Behaviors** (what it can do, like move or bark).

### Why Do We Use OOPS?
1. **Reusability:** We can use the same code in many places.
2. **Easy to Manage:** Makes it easier to add new features or fix problems.
3. **Safety:** Keeps important parts hidden from others.

---

## 2. Encapsulation (Keeping Things Safe)

Encapsulation means hiding some details and only showing what is needed. It’s like a TV remote – you can press buttons without knowing how it works inside.

### Key Points:
- **Public:** Anyone can see it.
- **Private:** Only the creator can see it.
- **Protected:** Special friends (subclasses) can see it.

### Example:
```java
class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("Srishti", 21);
        System.out.println(student.getDetails());
        student.setAge(22);
        System.out.println(student.getDetails());
    }
}
```

### Common Mistake:
Trying to access private things directly:
```java
System.out.println(student.name);  // Error
```
**Solution:** Use special methods like `getDetails`.

---

## 3. Inheritance (Like Family Traits)

Inheritance is when one class gets the features of another class. Imagine you inherit your parents' eye color or height.

### Types of Inheritance:
1. **Single Inheritance:** One child, one parent.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A child has a parent and a grandparent.
3. **Multiple Inheritance:** A child has two parents (supported through interfaces in Java).

### Example:
#### Single Inheritance:
```java
class Parent {
    public void showParent() {
        System.out.println("I am the parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public void showChild() {
        System.out.println("I am the child class");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.showParent();
        obj.showChild();
    }
}
```

#### Multilevel Inheritance:
```java
class Grandparent {
    public void showGrandparent() {
        System.out.println("I am the grandparent class");
    }
}

class Parent extends Grandparent {
    public void showParent() {
        System.out.println("I am the parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public void showChild() {
        System.out.println("I am the child class");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.showGrandparent();
        obj.showParent();
        obj.showChild();
    }
}
```

#### Multiple Inheritance (Using Interfaces):
```java
interface Parent1 {
    void showParent1();
}

interface Parent2 {
    void showParent2();
}

class Child implements Parent1, Parent2 {
    public void showParent1() {
        System.out.println("I am parent 1");
    }

    public void showParent2() {
        System.out.println("I am parent 2");
    }

    public void showChild() {
        System.out.println("I am the child");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.showParent1();
        obj.showParent2();
        obj.showChild();
    }
}
```

### Mistake:
Using inheritance for things that don’t match, like saying "A dog is a car." Use it only if it "is a" relationship.

## 4. Polymorphism (One Thing, Many Forms)

Polymorphism means one thing can do different jobs. For example, a remote can work with a TV, an AC, or a music system.

### Types of Polymorphism:
1. **Method Overloading:** Same name, different inputs.
2. **Method Overriding:** A child changes how the parent works.

### Example:
#### Method Overloading:
```java
class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));        // 5
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3, 4));     // 9
    }
}
```

#### Method Overriding:
```java
class Parent {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("I am the parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("I am the child");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show();  // I am the child
    }
}
```

### Mistake:
Not using `super` to call the parent.

**Solution:**
```java
class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        super.show();
        System.out.println("I am the child");
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Abstraction (Hiding the Details)

Abstraction is like using a phone – you can make a call without knowing how it works inside.

### Example:
```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double length;
    private double breadth;

    public Rectangle(double length, double breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return length * breadth;
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Area: " + rectangle.area());
    }
}
```

### Mistake:
Trying to use an abstract class directly:
```java
Shape shape = new Shape();  // Error
```
**Solution:** Use child classes instead.

---

## 6. SOLID Design Principles (Write Better Code)

1. **Single Responsibility:** Each class does one job.
2. **Open/Closed:** Code can grow without breaking old parts.
3. **Liskov Substitution:** A child class can replace a parent class.
4. **Interface Segregation:** Classes should not have to use things they don’t need.
5. **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstract ideas, not details.

### Example for Open/Closed:
```java
interface Shape {
    double area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double length;
    private double breadth;

    public Rectangle(double length, double breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return length * breadth;
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;

   

### SOLID Principles: Explanation and Examples

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five design principles intended to help software developers write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. These principles are widely used in object-oriented design (OOD).

---

#### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition:**
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

**Explanation:**
If a class is responsible for multiple things, it becomes difficult to modify and maintain. By following SRP, each class is focused on a single task, and changes in one responsibility do not affect others.

**Example:**
Consider a class `Invoice` that handles both the logic for calculating invoice totals and sending the invoice to a customer.

```python
class Invoice:
    def calculate_total(self):
        # Logic to calculate total amount
        pass

    def send_invoice(self):
        # Logic to send the invoice via email
        pass
```

Certainly! Below are the **SOLID** principles explained with Java code examples:

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Explanation**: A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should only handle one responsibility.

```java
// Before SRP: A class handling multiple responsibilities
class Invoice {
    public void calculateTotal() {
        // Logic for calculating total amount
    }
    
    public void sendEmail() {
        // Logic to send email with invoice
    }
}

// After SRP: Separated concerns into different classes
class Invoice {
    public void calculateTotal() {
        // Logic for calculating total amount
    }
}

class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail() {
        // Logic to send email with invoice
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Explanation**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. We can extend the behavior without changing existing code.

```java
// Base class
abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double calculateArea();
}

// Derived classes extend functionality
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width, height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

Here, the `Shape` class is open for extension (we can add new shapes), but it is closed for modification (we don't need to modify the base class).

---

### **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Explanation**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality.

```java
// Base class
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}

// Derived class that can be substituted
class Sparrow extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Sparrow flying");
    }
}

// Derived class that can break LSP if it does not follow the same behavior
class Penguin extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins cannot fly");
    }
}

// To follow LSP, we would adjust this by having different behaviors for flying birds
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Sparrow flying");
    }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    // No fly method here, as Penguin can't fly
}
```

In this case, we ensure that all subclasses that inherit from `Bird` adhere to the expected behavior by implementing interfaces such as `Flyable` when appropriate.

---

### **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Explanation**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. We break large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

```java
// Before ISP: A large interface that forces implementing all methods
interface MultiFunctionDevice {
    void print();
    void scan();
    void fax();
}

// After ISP: Smaller, more focused interfaces
interface Printer {
    void print();
}

interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}

interface Fax {
    void fax();
}

// A class can implement only the methods it needs
class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printer, Scanner, Fax {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing");
    }

    public void scan() {
        System.out.println("Scanning");
    }

    public void fax() {
        System.out.println("Faxing");
    }
}

class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing");
    }
}
```

With ISP, a class only implements the interfaces relevant to its behavior.

---

### **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Explanation**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).

```java
// Low-level module
class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("LightBulb: turned on");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("LightBulb: turned off");
    }
}

// Abstraction
interface Switchable {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
}

// High-level module depends on abstraction
class Switch {
    private Switchable device;

    public Switch(Switchable device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void operate() {
        device.turnOn();
    }
}

// Using the Switch with a LightBulb
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Switchable lightBulb = new LightBulb();
        Switch lightSwitch = new Switch(lightBulb);
        lightSwitch.operate(); // Output: LightBulb: turned on
    }
}
```

Here, the `Switch` class does not depend on the concrete `LightBulb` class but on the `Switchable` interface, allowing it to work with any object that implements this interface (e.g., fans, lamps).

---

### Conclusion:

These **SOLID** principles are key to building flexible, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented systems in Java. By adhering to these principles, developers can ensure that their code is modular, easier to understand, and adaptable to changes.
